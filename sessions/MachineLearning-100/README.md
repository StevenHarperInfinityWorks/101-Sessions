# Machine Learning 100

## Overview

This course is a practical introduction to machine learning. It's a massive
topic so just the basics will be covered, with a brief mention of some
slightly more advanced topics near the end.

The aim is to teach participants to understand how machine learning works and
help them to build some models. The course will also teach the basics of data
science and manipulating data using the Pandas library.

We will use the absolute bare minimum of maths, because people don't like 
maths and it puts them off trying to do ML.

This is not a course to teach attendees Python, it's assumed that they'll
already have a working knowledge of it.


## Session 1 - Introduction to ML

* [101.001.1](101/101.001/1.md) - Terminology - AI, ML, deep learning, reinforcement learning, model, etc
* [101.001.2](101/101.001/2.md) - What is machine learning used for?
* [101.001.3](101/101.001/3.md) - ML algorithms and the problem classes they can be applied to
* [101.001.4](101/101.001/4.md) - Basic machine learning workflow
* [101.001.5](101/101.001/5.md) - Regression: Hands on with linear regression using scikit-learn
* [101.001.6](101/101.001/6.md) - Classification: Support vector machines using scikit-learn


## Session 2 - Data wrangling

* [101.002.1](101/101.002/1.md) - Data exploration and features
* [101.002.2](101/101.002/2.md) - The importance of data quality
* [101.002.3](101/101.002/3.md) - Introduction to Pandas and dataframes
* [101.002.4](101/101.002/4.md) - "How to be evil"
* [101.002.5](101/101.002/5.md) - How much data is enough?
* [101.002.6](101/101.002/6.md) - Why imbalanced datasets can be problematic and what you can do about it


## Session 3 - Build & train a model from scratch

During this session we will put together all of the skills that we learned in
sessions 1 and 2. We'll clean a data set and train a model from scratch.

* [101.003.1](101/101.003/1.md) - Building a model from scratch
* [101.003.2](101/101.003/2.md) - Machine learning in production
