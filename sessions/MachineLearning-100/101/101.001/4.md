# Basic machine learning workflow

Very different to the usual software development lifecycle.

Some of these workflow steps are cyclical, so this will be discussed with the
aid of diagrams.

1. Define the business problem
    - Before you write any code make sure you have a solid understanding of what the value
      of the model is to the business. This provide a framework to guide your design decisions.

2. Collect relevant data
    - Existing data - may be gleaned from existing systems.
    - Additional data may need to be collected or purchased.
    
3. Data exploration and cleaning

4. Feature engineering
    - Creating new features with greater predictive power.

5. Training
    - Split data into training, validation and test sets. Typical ratio 70:20:10
    
6. Model evaluation
Basic methods:
    - Confusion matrix
    - Area under ROC curve
    - RMSE

7. Inference
    - Make predictions from your model
