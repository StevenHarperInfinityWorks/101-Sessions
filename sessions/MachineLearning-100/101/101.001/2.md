# What is machine learning used for?

## Where machine learning shines

- When it's not possible to define an algorithm to do a thing
- When you want to personalise a thing
- When you need to scale a thing


## Questions that machine learning can answer

“What is this thing?” - Classification
- “Is this a spam email?”

- “How positive or negative is this product review?”
- "What does this Spanish sentence mean in English?"

"What would this look like?" - Generating new data from existing data
