# Machine Learning Terminology

**Artificial Intelligence** - Software that mimics human intelligence

**Machine Learning** - A class of AI algorithms that use existing data to make predictions about the future.

**Deep Learning** - Machine learning algorithms that consist of many layers of interconnected neurons, mimicing the neural pathways of the human brain.   

**Reinforcement Learning** - Learning by practice. Lots and lots of practice.

**Model** - A machine learning algorithm that is able to make predictions.

**Data** - Information that a model can learn from, e.g. tabular, audio, image, video, sensor readings.

**Training** - Adjusting the parameters of a model to enable it to make predictions based on the training data.
