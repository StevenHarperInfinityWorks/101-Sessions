# Why imbalanced datasets can be problematic

Imbalanced datasets have a skewed class distribution.
Fraud detection is a good example. There are many transactions but very few are fraudulent.
Most often a problem in classification tasks.
If the minority classes are important, techniques exist to re-balance them.

## Re-balancing strategies

Discuss the pros and cons of the following approaches:

- Deleting data to re-balance classes
- Data augmentation strategies
  - Gather more data!
  - Weight balancing
    - Undersampling - Not using some data from the majority class to even things up. This discards useful information.
    - Oversampling - Create copies of the minority class such that the distribution of the minority class is maintained. This can lead to over-fitting  
  - Images - image augmentation

  - GANs
