## Poor quality data
A poorly curated dataset will be loaded and analysed as an exercise in what to look out for. 

- Mixed data types
- Multiple different representations for the same thing
- Differences in text capitalisation
- Different time formats and zones
- Missing data & strategies for handling it
- Default values
- Duplicated data
- Noisy data
- Inconsistent use of units
