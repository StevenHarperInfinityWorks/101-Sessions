# Data exploration
To help you to work out what data would be useful for your model, you need to find some data that has some relationship
to the thing you want to predict. 

## Types of data
Nominal - Labels, not quantities. Distances between values aren't meaningful. Can't be ordered. Examples: Colours, names. 

Ordinal - Have an order, but distances between values aren't meaningful. Example: Film rating stars. 

Interval - Ordered, and distances are meaningful, but without an absolute scale. Example: Temperature in celsius.

Ratio - Like interval data, but with an absolute scale. Example: Number of adults living at an address.

## Features
A "feature" is information that can be used by a machine learning model to generate predictions.
The meaning differs depending on the type of data.

- A "feature" in tabular data usually refers to the data in a column.
- A "feature" in image data is a fragment of an image that appears many times in the dataset.
- A "feature" in audio is a pattern in the audio signal that appears many times in the dataset.

## Visualisation is your friend
Plot the relationships between variables to see if you can immediately uncover patterns in the data.

Check for anomalies in the data that could impact your models. Are there a lot of outliers?

Apply filters and recodes based on what you learn from the first two steps.

Cycle: Collect -> Analyse -> Clean

## Correlation vs causation 
Be careful not to jump to conclusions about correlated data. Just because two values are correlated, it 
doesn't mean that they are related, they just have a symmetric relationship.

For example, in young school children their star sign correlates with their IQ, but this correlation weakens
with age and disappears by adulthood.
