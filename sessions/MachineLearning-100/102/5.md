# How much data is enough?
Short answer: it depends!

There are two levels at which we should ask this question: at the data set 
level and at the level of individual features and rows.

## The data set as a whole
More data is generally preferable, especially when using deep learning methods.

For simpler methods such as k-nearest neighbour clustering & SVM it's not 
necessary to have so much data, because the points around decision boundaries
contain much more information than points further away. You do need enough 
data to accurately define your decision boundaries, however.

Some rules of thumb:

- For image recognition AutoML you need at least 50 samples of each class.
- In k-nearest neighbour clustering you should have at least k samples in each cluster. 


## Individual features and rows
If a row contains incomplete data it's up to your judgement whether you think
it's usable. If you can infer the missing values that's great, if not you 
might want to remove it from the data set.

Similarly if a lot of data is missing for a particular feature you will want
to consider the same.
