# React example using JSX

Breaking up the app into two sections, to add a colour picker.

At this point, it makes sense to break the state up into multiple sections, one bit for the color picker, the other bit of state for the counter.

## Setup

* Run the code with `yarn start`.

## Learn

* We don't like the way that the colour changes as soon as you make the change, make it so you have to click a button instead.
