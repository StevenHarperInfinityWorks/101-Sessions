# React example using JSX

Using redux-api-middleware to handle dispatching events, which are picked up by middleware and cause API calls to be made.

## Setup

* Run the code with `yarn start`.

## Learn

* Display the error message when the API calls fail (why not try stopping the API server?)
* Make sure that intermittent failures are handled.
