# React example using JSX

Make API calls from within our components.

## Setup

* Run the API within the api directory
  * `yarn install`
  * `node index.js`
* Run the React app
  * `yarn run`

## Learn

* Review the new code for using side effects as API calls.
* Wonder how we're going to unit test all of this.
