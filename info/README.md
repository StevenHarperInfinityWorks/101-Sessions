Enter the building and tell reception you're here for an event at WeWork. They'll give you a visitor pass and let you through the barriers up to the mezzanine floor.

On the mezzanine floor is the WeWork reception, they'll show you where to go if you can't find us. We're in a meeting room behind the WeWork reception desk.
